## ‚öôÔ∏è **Key Features & Queries**
1. **Total Medal Count Analysis**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_medals
   FROM olympics
   WHERE medal <> 'nonmedal';
   ```

2. **Count of Unique Sports**
   ```sql
   SELECT DISTINCT(sport), COUNT(*) AS sport_count
   FROM olympics
   GROUP BY sport;
   ```

3. **Medal Analysis for Team India**
   ```sql
   SELECT Team, medal, COUNT(medal) AS countmedal
   FROM olympics
   WHERE Team = 'India' AND medal <> 'Nomedal'
   GROUP BY medal, Team;
   ```

4. **Athletes Winning Multiple Medals**
   ```sql
   SELECT Name, COUNT(medal) AS total_medals
   FROM olympics
   WHERE medal <> 'Nomedal'
   GROUP BY Name
   HAVING total_medals > 1;
   ```

5. **Top Medal-Winning Countries**
   ```sql
   SELECT Team, COUNT(medal) AS total_medals
   FROM olympics
   WHERE medal <> 'Nomedal'
   GROUP BY Team
   ORDER BY total_medals DESC;
   ```
